🚢 Titanic Survival Data Analysis
This project is part of my data science internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
In this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover survival trends based on features like gender, age, passenger class, and more.

🔧 Tools Used
Python
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
🎯 Goals of the Analysis
Inspect and understand the structure of the dataset
Handle missing values and perform feature engineering
Explore and visualize patterns in survival rates
Analyze the impact of variables like Sex, Pclass, AgeGroup, Title, and FamilySize on survival
📊 Key Insights
Females had higher survival rates than males across most classes.
Children and first-class passengers had better chances of survival.
Family size had a U-shaped relation with survival chances.
Passengers with titles like "Mrs", "Miss", and "Master" had different survival outcomes based on social class.
