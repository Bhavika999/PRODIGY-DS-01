🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - EDA & Modeling
This project is part of my internship work, where I explored the Titanic dataset to perform data analysis and build predictive models. The goal was to understand the factors influencing passenger survival and apply machine learning techniques to predict outcomes.

📂 Project Overview
Dataset: Titanic dataset from Kaggle

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Objectives:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Visualize key patterns and correlations

Build and evaluate machine learning models for survival prediction

🔍 Key Insights
Gender and class were strong predictors of survival.

Passengers with fewer family members onboard tended to survive more.

Preprocessing like encoding, feature engineering, and imputation improved model performance.

📊 Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

(Add any others if you used them)

📝 Files Included
Titan.ipynb: The complete Jupyter Notebook with analysis, visualizations, and modeling

README.md: Overview of the project

titanic.csv: Dataset (optional, if you include it)

✅ Results
Achieved an accuracy score of around XX% (update with your best model score) using the Random Forest model.
